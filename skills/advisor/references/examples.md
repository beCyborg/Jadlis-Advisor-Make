## NomadList (Nomads.com) — Full Journey

This is the primary case study that demonstrates the complete indie maker pipeline from idea to scaled product.

### Idea Stage

**Problem identification:** Levels was traveling through Asia and could not find which cities had fast internet combined with affordable cost of living. No tool existed to answer this question.

**Solution:** Created a private Google Spreadsheet with 25 cities and columns for temperature, internet speed, and cost of living.

**Accidental validation:** Set the spreadsheet to "editable by everyone" by mistake. Within 1 month, thousands of people discovered it, added 250+ cities, and created additional data columns Levels had not considered.

**Lesson:** Solve your own genuine problem. If the problem is real for you, there is a high probability it is real for many others. Validation can happen organically before you build anything.

### Build Stage

**Technology:** Built with PHP. Simple, lightweight stack. Nothing fancy.

**DIY advantage:** Levels describes himself as not great at programming or design, but pretty average at both. Because he can do everything well enough across all disciplines, he has an advantage over specialists who need teams.

**Competitive result:** Beat 5 VC-funded competitors who had $1M-$10M in funding and 10-30 person teams. Levels did this while working alone in his underwear on the side of his hotel bed with his MacBook.

**Lesson:** A solo generalist who ships fast beats a well-funded team that moves slowly. Speed and direct feedback loops matter more than resources.

### Launch Stage

**Product Hunt:** Named Maker of the Year, twice.

**Reddit launches:**
- First Reddit launch: posted to r/dataisbeautiful. Made the front page. Comments were brutal, attacking data validity. But the traffic was massive regardless.
- Hoodmaps (spin-off product): made Reddit front page. Some hate about the sensitive nature of neighborhood labels. Levels banned sensitive words to mitigate.

**Lesson:** Launches generate attention. Negative comments still drive traffic. Do not let hostile reactions on launch platforms discourage you. The traffic converts even when commenters are angry.

### Grow Stage

**Community building using off-the-shelf tools:**
- Slack for community chat (seeded initially with personal friends to create activity)
- Discourse for discussion forums
- Big banner on the main site driving signups

**Spin-off strategy:** Extracted the coworking space feature into PlacesToWork, a separate app with GPS functionality. This gave an entirely new launch cycle.

**Build in public:** Shared the journey openly, creating ongoing attention.

**Dynamic share images:** City thumbnails with data (internet speed, cost, temperature) overlaid directly on city photos. Every city page had a unique, compelling share image.

**Human-readable URLs:** Filter states translated to natural language paths like `nomads.com/cities-with-fast-internet-safe-for-women-to-travel-alone-near-a-beach`.

**API risk realized:** Shared all data via API. Within 90 days, 6 clones appeared (English, Russian, Chinese versions). API was disabled.

**Lesson:** Layer multiple growth strategies. Each one compounds. But protect your core data asset.

### Monetize Stage — Community Pricing Ladder

| Price Point | What Happened |
|-------------|--------------|
| Free | Spammers flooded in, community quality dropped to unusable |
| $1 | Spammers disappeared, but quality remained low |
| $5 | Noticeably better quality users |
| $25 | Much better quality conversations and connections |
| $50 | 10 signups per day = $500/day = $15,000/month |

Levels did not intend to monetize this way. He wanted to stop spammers and accidentally discovered his monetization model. Every price increase caused signups to drop for about a week, then recover to the same level at the higher price.

Revenue trajectory: $100K/month grew to $200K/month grew to $3M+/year across all projects combined.

Market expansion: Digital nomads (small niche) expanded to expats and general travelers (approximately 1,000x bigger addressable market).

**Lesson:** Price can be a quality filter, not just a revenue mechanism. Raising prices can improve your product by selecting better users.

### Automate Stage

- 700-2,000 robots running continuously, listed on the team page as actual team members
- Robots handle: meetup organization, data collection from 25 sources, thumbnail generation, social sharing
- Customer support handled by a contractor at $2,500/month
- Developer on standby at $50+/hour, activated only when monitoring alerts trigger

**Lesson:** The entire operation runs with robots plus minimal contractor support. No employees. No office. No management overhead.

## GoFuckingDoIt — Controversial Launch

### Concept

Goal-setting app with financial consequences. Users set a goal, set a deadline, and enter their credit card. If they fail to meet the deadline, their card is charged. Levels keeps the money.

### Controversial Decisions

Two decisions that friends and advisors argued against:

1. **Money goes to Levels, not charity.** Friends said donating the penalty to charity would be more palatable. Levels kept it for himself. This made the product more controversial and more talked about.

2. **Kept "fucking" in the name.** Friends said to remove the profanity. Levels refused. The name made the product memorable and generated press coverage that a bland name never would.

Both decisions went against conventional safe advice.

### Result

The product went viral across press outlets. Every single time Levels presented GoFuckingDoIt, the audience started laughing. The name alone was a marketing asset.

### Business Model

Conditional payments. Users do not pay for the service. They pay for their own failure. Money as a disciplinary tool.

**Lesson:** Controlled controversy combined with genuine alignment to your values generates free viral marketing. Do not sanitize your product to avoid offending people who were never going to use it anyway.

## Remote OK — Automated Job Board

### Product

Remote jobs board. Described as the most visited remote job board in the world, with 3 million monthly visits.

### How It Works

Built and run by Levels alone. Robots browse 100+ job boards, parse job listings, filter for remote positions, post them to Remote OK, share on social media, and email subscribers. The entire pipeline is automated.

### Economics

Profit margins reach up to 95%. Revenue is part of the $3M+/year combined portfolio.

**Lesson:** A highly automated product with massive scale and minimal human intervention. The job board model (B2B pricing at $49-$299 per post) combined with automation creates extremely high margins.

## Unsplash / Crew — Side Project Marketing

### Story

Crew.co was a freelancer marketplace. It was the main business, and it was struggling. To generate traffic and attention, the team launched Unsplash as a side project: a free stock photography site.

Unsplash became bigger than Crew itself. The side project eclipsed the main product.

The team also launched HowMuchToMakeAnApp.com, an app cost calculator. Both side projects received massive press coverage.

The Crew team later wrote a blog post titled "Side projects saved our startup."

**Lesson:** Side project marketing works. Decouple a feature or related concept, launch it as a standalone product, and get an entirely separate launch cycle with separate press coverage. The side project drives traffic and awareness back to the main product, or can become the main product itself.

## Plenty of Fish — Bootstrap to $575M

### Product

Dating website. Built and run by a single person, Markus Frind.

### Journey

Bootstrapped entirely. No venture capital. By the time Frind found out what VCs were, he was already making millions in profit. There was no need to raise money because the company was profitable from early on.

### Exit

Sold to Match Group for $575 million in cash.

Frind's statement: "It was a profitable company, and there was no need to raise money."

**Lesson:** Bootstrapped companies can achieve exits that rival VC-funded companies. The key is profitability without external funding. When you do not need money, you have maximum negotiating power if and when a buyer approaches.

## Minecraft / @notch — Post-Exit Emotional Reality

### Exit

Markus Persson (notch) sold Minecraft to Microsoft for $2.5 billion.

### Aftermath

Persson reported: "Never felt more isolated." The sale changed friendship dynamics. Relationships became complicated by the wealth differential. Identity, previously tied to being the Minecraft creator, was suddenly unmoored.

**Lesson:** Money alone does not solve existential or identity issues. A massive exit can create new emotional problems that did not exist before. Prepare emotionally before selling. Build an identity that extends beyond the company. Consult a psychologist during major life transitions.

## Basecamp (37signals) — Agency to SaaS

### Origin

Started as a web design agency in 1999. Built websites for clients.

### Evolution

While doing client work, the team built internal tools to manage projects. They noticed every client had similar project management problems. Instead of building custom solutions each time, they productized their internal tool into Basecamp.

### Result

Revenue estimated at $168 million. A small web agency productized their clients' common problems into a massive company.

**Lesson:** If you do agency, consulting, or freelance work, pay attention to patterns in client problems. The solution you build repeatedly for different clients is a product waiting to be extracted and sold at scale.

---

## Typeform — Client Project to Product

### Origin

David Okuniev was building a lead generation form for a toilet company's exhibition booth. The brief required something more inspiring than a plain vanilla form.

### Result

The form experience Okuniev created was so different from existing tools that it became its own product: Typeform.

**Lesson:** Client projects can become products. The constraint of a specific client need can force creative solutions that have broad market appeal. Critical requirement: ensure you own the intellectual property rights to what you build.

## Dribbble — Free Platform + Job Board Revenue

### Free Product

Design portfolio showcase. Designers post their work, get feedback, build reputation.

### Revenue Model

Job board attached to the free platform. Companies post design job listings at $299 per post.

### Numbers

Approximately 5 posts per day equals $45,000 per month, or $540,000 per year.

### Pattern

Free content generates traffic and builds an audience of qualified professionals. The job board monetizes by connecting employers (B2B customers willing to pay high prices) with that qualified audience.

**Lesson:** You do not need to monetize the free product itself. Attach a B2B service that targets the audience your free product attracts. The free product is the moat; the B2B service is the revenue.

## Buffer — Build in Public + Validation

### Transparency

From day one, Buffer shared every step of building the company on the Buffer Open blog. Revenue numbers, hiring decisions, failures, internal debates were all public.

### Validation Technique

The original Buffer MVP had a "Plans and Pricing" button on the landing page. There was no product behind it. Clicking the button led to an email signup. The number of people who clicked through to pricing and signed up validated that people would pay before any code was written.

### Side Projects

Buffer launched Pablo (an image editor for social media) and Respond (a customer service tool) as separate products, each getting its own launch cycle.

**Lesson:** Transparency builds an audience that becomes your distribution channel. Validate willingness to pay before building. Side projects create multiple launch opportunities from a single team.

## The MAKE Book — Meta-Validation

The book itself demonstrates the methodology it teaches.

### Process

1. **Pre-order before writing:** Announced the book and opened pre-orders before writing a single line of content
2. **Landing page:** Typeform asking for $29.99 payment, which delivered an empty Workflowy list where buyers could suggest topics
3. **Immediate revenue:** Thousands pre-ordered, generating $50,000+ in revenue instantly
4. **Public drafts:** Wrote chapter drafts in Google Docs, visible to anyone
5. **Livestreamed writing:** Streamed the writing process on Twitch
6. **Customer review:** Sent chapter drafts to pre-order customers for review and feedback
7. **90% of the process was out in the open**

**Lesson:** This is the full methodology applied to itself. Launch early (pre-order before the product exists). Build with users (Workflowy topic suggestions and Google Docs chapter reviews). Monetize immediately ($29.99 pre-order). Build in public (Twitch streams of the writing process). The book's existence and commercial success is proof that the system works.
