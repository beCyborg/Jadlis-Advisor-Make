# Press Outreach

Procedural reference for getting press coverage as an indie maker. Specific templates, journalist outreach workflow, and controversy-as-marketing tactics.

## Why Press Matters

Press coverage reaches mainstream, non-techy users who will never visit Product Hunt or Hacker News. These are users outside your niche bubble — the general public who read TechCrunch, Forbes, or WIRED and discover products through articles.

**The Product Hunt → Press pipeline:**
A successful Product Hunt launch triggers press coverage within hours. Tech journalists browse Product Hunt daily looking for stories. A top-5 PH placement can generate 50,000+ additional visitors over the following weeks through press articles alone — far more than the PH traffic itself.

Press is a multiplier on other launch channels, not a standalone strategy.

## Why Press Matters Less Than It Used To

The landscape has shifted. Press is still useful but less essential than before.

**Reasons:**
- People read traditional tech press less — Product Hunt and social media partially automated the tech discovery cycle
- Deep mistrust of press: "Readers aren't sure if what they're reading is a paid advertorial"
- Sponsored content and native advertising blurred the line between editorial and promotion
- Direct-to-consumer channels (Twitter, newsletters, communities) bypass press entirely

**The conclusion:** "You might need press to kickstart traction, but definitely need it less and less." Use press as one channel in a multi-channel launch strategy. Do not depend on it exclusively.

## Control the Conversation

Press is not your friend. Press is a tool. Use it strategically.

**Procedure before engaging with any journalist:**
1. Check their previous articles. What do they usually write about? What angle do they take? Are they constructive or do they write takedown pieces?
2. Set the story angle yourself. Provide the journalist with a clear narrative. If you do not set the story, they will invent one — and it may not be the story you want told.
3. After publication, fact-check the article. Read it carefully. Are the facts correct? Is the tone accurate?
4. Request corrections if anything is wrong. Most publications have a corrections process. Use it.

"Press can easily flip a story to become negative in favor of page views. Press is not necessarily your friend." A journalist's incentive is to write an engaging article that gets clicks. Your incentive is to get positive coverage that drives signups. These incentives do not always align.

## Process: Building a Press List

### Step 1: Find Relevant Journalists

Do NOT email generic tips addresses. Do not email tips@thenextweb.com, tips@techcrunch.com, or any similar inbox. "Industry's black holes. A lot goes in. Not much comes out."

Instead, find specific journalists who cover your industry or niche.

**How to find them:**
- Search for articles about your competitors. Who wrote them?
- Search for articles about your industry/topic. Who covers that beat?
- Every journalist has their niche: some cover crypto, others travel tech, others bootstrapped startups, others AI
- Find the journalists whose niche matches YOUR product

"Shooting 1 targeted email results in more success than 1,000 non-targeted emails." One well-researched email to a journalist who covers your exact niche is worth more than a mass blast to 500 irrelevant contacts.

### Step 2: Use Directories and Research

**Tools for finding journalist contacts:**
- Submit.co: directory of tech journalist contact information
- Check competitor press pages — which outlets covered them?
- Search "[competitor name] + TechCrunch/Forbes/WIRED" to find specific writers
- Search by industry keyword + journalist/writer

### Step 3: Build a Tracking Spreadsheet

Maintain a spreadsheet with every journalist contact:

| Name | Outlet | Niche | Email | Emailed? | Replied? | Will Feature? | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Susan Park | TNW | Remote work | susan@tnw.com | 2024-03-15 | Yes | Yes | Liked the data angle |
| James Liu | Forbes | Bootstrapped | james@forbes.com | 2024-03-15 | No | - | Try again next launch |

Track every interaction. This spreadsheet becomes increasingly valuable over time as you build relationships and learn which journalists respond to which angles.

### Step 4: Maintain Warm Connections

A journalist who has written about you before is an extremely valuable warm connection.

**How to maintain the relationship:**
- Keep them in the loop about major updates (do not bug them with every minor feature)
- Give them scoops: offer exclusive early access to major announcements before the public launch
- Exclusive news is currency for journalists — it gets them clicks and establishes them as a source
- If they liked writing about you before, they will be happy to write about you again

**Procedure for warm contacts:**
1. After a journalist writes about you, send a brief thank-you email
2. Add them to a separate "warm press" list
3. Before each major launch, email your warm list first with exclusive early access
4. Frame it as: "I wanted to give you first look before the public launch"

## Conversion Rate

Set realistic expectations. Press outreach has a low conversion rate.

- Expect less than 5% of contacted journalists to write about you
- 100 targeted emails → approximately 5 press features (and this is optimistic)
- "It might take hundreds of targeted emails"
- This is normal and expected — do not be discouraged

**The math still works:**
- 5 articles from respected outlets can drive 50,000+ visitors
- That is 500 visitors per email sent (100 emails / 50,000 visitors)
- Compare to paid advertising: 50,000 targeted visitors could cost $25,000-$100,000+
- Press outreach costs: $0 and a few hours of work

## Email Templates

### The BAD Email (What 99% of Founders Send)

```
Subject: New startup Petsy.com

Hi TechCrunch!

We just launched our new startup Petsy. It's funded with a
Series A round led by Lion Capital.

We're growing like crazy, crushing it right now. Our platform
leverages cutting-edge AI to disrupt the pet food industry with
a best-in-class subscription model.

We'd love for you to feature us. Please let us know if you're
interested in writing about our journey.

Best regards,
-Rick CEO, Founder Petsy.com

This e-mail is intended for the addressee shown. It may contain
information that is confidential...
[legal disclaimer paragraph]
```

**Why this email fails:**
- Way too long — "ain't nobody got time for this"
- Gets to the point too late (what does the product actually DO?)
- Addressed to the publication, not a specific journalist
- Vague subject line that communicates nothing
- Vague bragging: "crushing it," "growing like crazy" — means nothing without numbers
- Buzzwords and jargon: "leverages," "cutting-edge," "disrupt," "best-in-class"
- No clickable link to the actual product
- Ridiculous legal disclaimer (screams corporate, not indie)
- "From a distance, it's just a block of text" — journalists skim emails in seconds

### The GOOD Email (2-Sentence Template)

```
Subject: Food delivery startup for pets

Hi Susan! I made a site that lets you subscribe to food
delivery for your pet. Let me know if you need more info :)

https://petsy.com
```

**Why this email works:**
- Two sentences maximum — respects the journalist's time
- Friendly and personal, not salesy or corporate
- Clear, specific subject line that communicates exactly what the product is
- Journalist can click the link and evaluate the product themselves
- Low friction — they reply only if genuinely interested
- No pressure, no desperation, no "please feature us"

### The BETTER Email (Personal Touch)

```
Subject: Food delivery startup for your puppy Robert de Niro

Hi Jody! I made a site that lets you subscribe to food
delivery for your pet. Maybe it'll save you some time
feeding Robert DeNiro.

https://petsy.com
```

**Why this is better:**
- Shows you actually researched the journalist as a person
- Personal detail (their dog's name, found from their social media or articles) creates genuine connection
- Same conciseness with added relevance
- Journalist thinks: "This person actually read my work / knows who I am" instead of "This is a mass email"

**How to find personal details:**
- Read their recent articles and Twitter feed
- Look for pets, hobbies, locations, opinions they have shared publicly
- Reference something specific and genuine — do not fake it

## Response Protocol

### When a Journalist Replies

**Reply IMMEDIATELY.** Not in a few hours. Not tomorrow. Now.

"They might be waiting to write the article right now." Journalists work on deadlines. They are often writing the article at the moment they email you for more information. A slow reply means they scrap your story and write about something else.

### What Journalists Typically Ask

After your initial email, a interested journalist will usually reply with something like:

"Nice! Do you have funding? Revenue? Market size? Screenshots I can use?"

### Your Response Procedure

1. **Answer concisely with facts, not bragging.** "We're at $5K MRR with 500 users, all organic growth, no funding." Not: "We're crushing it and growing like crazy."

2. **Send screenshots that are ALREADY perfect.** Crop them. Format them. Make them high-resolution. Make them publication-ready. Do not send raw screen captures with browser chrome and bookmark bars visible.

3. **Make it as easy as possible for them to write about you.** Every piece of friction you remove increases the chance of coverage. If they have to crop your screenshots, resize your images, or ask follow-up questions for basic facts — you have added friction.

"Make a journalist's job easy and they'll be happy to write about you!" The journalist who has everything they need in one email will write the article. The journalist who has to send 3 follow-up emails might not bother.

## Controversy as Marketing

### The Principle

"News" literally means things that are new. Same product with the same story format produces no coverage. For press to write about you, either the product must be radically different OR the story must be told differently.

"Controversy is by definition different than the norm." A controversial angle is inherently newsworthy because it deviates from the standard narrative.

### Case Study: GoFuckingDoIt

A goal-setting app with a penalty mechanism: if you fail your goal, your credit card gets charged.

**Controversial decisions that drove virality:**

1. **"If you fail, I keep the money."** Friends told Levels to donate penalty money to charity. He refused. He kept the money himself. This was deliberately provocative — and it made the product more interesting to talk about.

2. **"Fucking" in the product name.** Friends told him to remove the profanity. He kept it. The name was memorable, shareable, and impossible to ignore. Every time someone mentioned the product, the name itself was a conversation starter.

Both decisions were controversial. Both were deliberate. Both drove press coverage and viral sharing. "Every single time I presented the idea, the audience started laughing." Laughter means engagement. Engagement means sharing.

### Case Study: MAKE Book

The core message of the MAKE book: "VC is bad, indie is good."

This is a deliberately simplified and controversial framing. The reality is more nuanced — but nuance does not spread. A bold, slightly provocative message does.

**Why it worked:**
- Aligned with genuine values (not controversy for controversy's sake)
- Simple enough to communicate in one sentence
- Provocative enough to generate debate and discussion
- "People don't have a lot of time, so get your point across"

### The Rule

Controversy must align with your genuine values. Manufactured controversy without authentic belief behind it gets exposed quickly and backfires.

**Procedure for controversial positioning:**
1. Identify what you genuinely believe that goes against mainstream thinking
2. State it simply and boldly — no hedging, no "well, it depends"
3. Be prepared for backlash — it is part of the strategy
4. Stand firm on your position — changing your mind under pressure signals inauthenticity
5. Let the controversy create awareness; let the product create conversion

## Press Outlets Quick Reference

### Tech Press
TNW (The Next Web), Forbes, Lifehacker, Quartz, Mashable, Fast Company, Entrepreneur, Business Insider, WIRED, Inc.

### Mainstream Press
HuffPost, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Washington Post, CNBC, CNN, The Telegraph, Observer, VICE

### Finding Niche Press
Do not limit yourself to the outlets listed above. Every industry has its own publications.

**Procedure:**
1. Search where your competitors have been covered
2. Search "[your industry] + blog/magazine/publication"
3. Find industry-specific publications relevant to your product's domain
4. Niche press often has higher conversion rates than mainstream press — the audience is more targeted

## Approach Channels

**Email is the primary and preferred channel.** Journalists still read email. They skim fast — which is why your email must be short — but they do read it.

**What journalists hate:** Being approached through Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. These platforms are for their personal or professional networking, not for receiving pitches. A cold DM on Twitter asking for coverage feels invasive. An email feels professional.

**The procedure is simple:**
1. Find their email address (Submit.co, their author page, their Twitter bio, their personal website)
2. Send a 2-sentence email with a link
3. Wait
4. If no reply after 1 week, move on to the next journalist
5. Do not follow up more than once — if they are not interested, a second email will not change that
