# Idea Validation

Procedural reference for validating product ideas before building. Every technique here comes from real shipping experience, not theory.

## Problem-First Approach

The single most reliable way to find a product idea: solve your own problems.

**Why it works:**
- You have first-hand experience with the pain — no guessing required
- You are simultaneously the builder AND the target user
- You can test every iteration on yourself before shipping
- Your judgment about what matters is informed by lived experience, not surveys

**The target audience rule:** If you stop being the target audience, the product suffers. When Pieter Levels stopped traveling full-time, NomadList's development suffered because he lost the daily friction that drove feature decisions. The moment you stop experiencing the problem, you start guessing — and guessing is where products go wrong.

**Why customer interviews are overrated:** Part of the Lean Startup approach dictates "talk to customers." That's nice, but you're still working from an outside perspective. You are interpreting what someone else tells you about their problem. When you solve your own problem, there is no interpretation layer. You know the problem because you live it.

**Procedure when evaluating any idea:**
1. Ask: "Do I personally have this problem?"
2. If yes — you have a massive advantage. Proceed.
3. If no — ask: "Can I put myself in a position where I DO have this problem?"
4. If neither — the idea requires customer research, which is slower, less accurate, and more expensive. Consider finding a different idea.

## Becoming More Original

Same life produces same ideas as everyone else. If you live the same lifestyle as millions of other people — commute, office, Netflix, repeat — you will have the same ideas as millions of other people. Todo apps. Photo sharing. Friend tracking. Calendar tools.

**The originality procedure:**
- Do unique things to encounter unique problems
- Travel to unfamiliar places
- Work in unusual environments
- Combine unrelated skills or domains
- Put yourself in situations most people avoid

**Concrete proof:** "I would have never built NomadList if I didn't go traveling." The product came directly from the experience of trying to find cities to work from as a digital nomad. No amount of brainstorming in a bedroom would have produced that idea.

**The anti-pattern:** Stop reading books for ideas. Stop browsing startup idea lists. Stop attending brainstorming sessions. Get ideas from life experience. Ideas that come from living are grounded in real problems. Ideas that come from brainstorming are grounded in imagination.

## Problem vs Solution Test

Before building anything, apply this test: "Does this problem exist without my solution?"

**How to apply the test:**

Take your idea and strip away the solution. What remains? If a real problem remains, the idea has potential. If nothing remains, you are building a solution looking for a problem.

**ANTI-PATTERN: Starting from solution or technology.** "I want to build something with GPS tracking" is not a problem. It is a technology. "I want to build something with blockchain" is not a problem. It is a technology.

**Failed example — GPS friend tracking:**
- Technology: GPS on phones
- Proposed solution: Track where your friends are in real-time
- Problem test: Do people actually need to know where their friends are at all times?
- Reality: No. This idea has been tried for a decade by multiple companies. It is a terrible idea because the underlying problem does not exist. People do not wake up thinking "I wish I knew where my friends are right now."

**Successful example — Tinder:**
- Technology: GPS on phones
- Proposed solution: Show you potential dates who are physically nearby
- Problem test: Do people want to meet potential romantic partners near them?
- Reality: Yes. This is a massive, real problem. Loneliness, desire for connection, and proximity all create genuine demand.

Same technology (GPS), completely different outcomes. The difference is whether a real problem exists underneath.

**Procedure:**
1. Write down your idea
2. Remove the solution/technology component
3. State the remaining problem as a sentence
4. Ask: "Do real people experience this problem regularly?"
5. Ask: "How do they currently solve it?" (If they don't try to solve it at all, the problem may not be painful enough)

## Niche Expansion Ladder

Start with the smallest viable niche. Expand only after dominating it. This is a step-by-step procedure, not a suggestion.

**Step 1 — Micro-niche:** Pick a ridiculously specific market.

Example: Booking software for African hairdressers.
- Potential customers: ~10,000
- Capture 10% = 1,000 customers
- At $83/month = $1,000,000/year

That is a million-dollar business from a market most people would dismiss as "too small."

**Step 2 — Multi-niche:** Expand to adjacent sub-niches.

From African hairdressers to Asian hair salons, then general hairdressers. Each expansion follows the path of least resistance — "like lightning in slow motion, finding the path of least resistance from cloud to ground."

**Step 3 — Adjacent markets:** Move to related industries.

From hairdressers to nail salons, tattoo shops, spas, restaurants. The core product (booking software) transfers. Each market requires minor adaptations, not rebuilds.

**Step 4 — Platform:** Become infrastructure.

From booking software to payment gateway, ecommerce platform, business management suite. You now serve entire ecosystems, not just niches.

**Historical proof this works every time:**
- Facebook: Started as Hot Or Not clone at Harvard (micro-niche) → expanded to other colleges (multi-niche) → opened to everyone (adjacent) → became a platform with apps, marketplace, payments
- Apple: Started as a hacker kit for hobbyists → personal computer → ecosystem of devices, services, and developer platform
- Google: Started as Stanford intranet search → web search for everyone → advertising, email, cloud, phones, everything
- NomadList: Started as a spreadsheet of 25 cities for digital nomads → grew into a social platform → became the remote work platform with jobs, housing, community

**The rule:** Never start at Step 4. Always start at Step 1. The path reveals itself only after you begin.

## Idea Tracking Pipeline

Use a structured pipeline to manage ideas over time. Tools: Trello, Workflowy, or any list tool with multiple columns.

**Four columns:**

1. **Concepts** — Raw ideas. Zero judgment on quality. Everything goes here. Bad ideas, weird ideas, obvious ideas. The point is capture, not evaluation. You cannot judge an idea the moment it appears.

2. **Promising** — Ideas that keep coming back to your mind. If you wrote something down 3 weeks ago and you are still thinking about it, move it here. The subconscious mind is a better filter than conscious analysis.

3. **Building** — Actively executing. Only 1-2 items here at any time. If you have 5 things in Building, you are not building — you are dabbling.

4. **Success/Failure** — Completed experiments with a 1-sentence post-mortem. "Failed because nobody searched for this." "Succeeded because remote workers needed it daily." These post-mortems compound into pattern recognition over time.

**The rice cooker principle:** "Ideas cook in your mind like a rice cooker. Some take 2 years to manifest." Do not force ideas through the pipeline. Let them simmer. The ones that keep coming back are the ones worth building.

## Idea x Execution Formula

An idea alone is worth nothing. Execution is the multiplier.

| | No execution ($0) | Good execution ($100K) | Great execution ($1M) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bad idea (0) | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Good idea (10) | $0 | $1M | $10M |
| Great idea (20) | $0 | $2M | $20M |

As Derek Sivers put it: "Ideas are just a multiplier of execution."

A great idea with no execution is worth exactly zero. A good idea with great execution is worth $10M. This is why hoarding ideas is irrational — the value is entirely in the building.

## Sharing Ideas Openly

**Why you must share ideas:**

1. **Execution divergence:** Give 10 people the same idea and you get 10 completely different products. Execution differs so radically that idea overlap is irrelevant. Nobody will build YOUR version of the idea.

2. **Feedback evolves ideas:** Sharing exposes the idea to perspectives you cannot generate alone. Each conversation adds a dimension you missed.

3. **Optimism bias correction:** When you keep an idea in your head, you overestimate its potential. You are in an echo chamber of one. Sharing breaks the echo chamber.

4. **Market validation:** Real validation comes from the market — from people using and paying for a product. Not from friends saying "great idea!" Not from your own excitement. The only way to know if an idea works is to expose it to reality.

**What happens when you do NOT share:**
- The idea stays in your head, unchallenged
- You build for months based on assumptions
- Launch day reveals problems you could have caught in week one
- You cannot ask "will this idea work?" — you need to ask the market by building it

---

## Avoiding Groupthink

Teams create groupthink. Two or more people working together on an idea start reinforcing each other's beliefs.

**The pattern:**
1. Team gets excited about idea
2. Team members hype each other: "We've got something really good here!"
3. Mild user validation gets ignored because the team's internal energy is high
4. Months pass before reality check
5. Launch reveals the market does not care

**Why solo is more rational:** "You're more rational on your own." Without a team amplifying excitement, you face reality more directly. Your doubts are not drowned out by collective enthusiasm.

**The worst validation source:** "The worst is people who just confirm what you already think." Friends, family, and team members who say "yeah, that sounds great!" are not validating your idea. They are being polite. Or they are caught in the same excitement loop.

**The only valid validation:** Build it. Ship it. See if people pay. "You can't ask 'will this idea work.' You need to ask the market by building it!"

## Revenue Math for Niches

Niches are more profitable than most people believe. The math:

- $5,000 product x 200 customers = $1,000,000
- $1,000 product x 1,000 customers = $1,000,000
- $100 product x 10,000 customers = $1,000,000
- $83/month subscription x 1,000 customers = $1,000,000/year

"If you have 'just' 1,000 people paying $83.33/month, that's $1M/year."

1,000 customers is not a lot. In a world of billions of internet users, finding 1,000 people who need your specific solution is very achievable — especially if you start with a well-defined niche where those people already congregate.

**Procedure for revenue estimation:**
1. Estimate the total addressable market for your micro-niche (number of potential customers)
2. Assume 1-10% capture rate (be conservative)
3. Multiply by your price point
4. If the math works at 1% capture — the niche is viable
5. If the math only works at 50% capture — the niche is too small or price too low

## Anti-patterns Summary

Avoid these when validating ideas:

1. **Solution-first thinking** — Starting from a technology or solution and searching for a problem to attach to it. Reverse the order: problem first, always.

2. **Thinking big from day one** — Planning to be a platform before you have built a single feature. Start with micro-niche. Expand later.

3. **Requiring earth-shattering ideas** — Most successful products are not revolutionary. They are well-executed solutions to specific problems. Do not wait for lightning to strike.

4. **Not sharing ideas (hoarding)** — Keeping ideas secret because someone might steal them. They will not. And even if they try, their execution will be completely different.

5. **Groupthink validation instead of market validation** — Getting excited because your team or friends are excited. The only validation that counts is people paying money.
